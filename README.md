### The goal is to create an algorithm for detecting anomalies in data

### Tasks:

1. Learn to find anomalies in the raw event log and system event model using a set of rules
2. To understand which parameters of which algorithms for building a system model of events break the detection of anomalies
3. Calculate the anomaly detection performance in logs and models. Detect a dependency between them

### Scheme of algorithms

The figure below shows the scheme of the algorithm that finds anomalies in system model# anomaly-detector

The picture below shows the implementation scheme of the anomaly detection algorithm on event logs
